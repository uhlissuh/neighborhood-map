#Neighborhood Map Project

This is a single page landmark exploration app for my hometown of Arcata, Ca. It was build to satisfy the requirements for Udacity's Full Stack Nanodegree Project 6. I used the Knockout library for MVVM functionality and Twitter Bootstrap for design. The Wikipedia API provides users with information about landmarks. The app is mobile responsive.
